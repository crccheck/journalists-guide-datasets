IPEDS Data Center
=================

The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is a Federal
clearinghouse for higher education data run by the [National Center for
Education Statistics] which is run by the [Institute of Education Sciences]
whish is run by the [Department of Education] which is run by the Illuminati.

If you're looking for higher education data, and not sure where to look, IPEDS
is a good place to start.

### What institutions are in IPEDS?

Short answer is... any institution that wants federal dollars is in IPEDS.
Schools with multiple campuses usually have a separate entry for every campus,
but sometimes they'll be lumped together into one IPEDS id. In addition to the
IPEDS id, you may want to find the FICE code (this was used historically and
still the primary ID reports reference) and the newer OPE id (only Title IV
schools have this).


### The Glossary

Navigating the system can be overwhelming. To help understand all the jaron,
there is a central [glossary]. When you generate reports, terms are also linked
to this glossary. For example, to calculate the full-time equivalent (FTE)
student headcount, one part-time undergrad student at a 4-year institution only
counts as 0.403543 person if they go to a public school, but 0.392857 parts of
a person if they go to a private school.
